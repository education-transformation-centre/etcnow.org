                Collaboration with host schools will facilitate a bridge for a

                mental health goals are met or an intensive level of services
                are no longer needed.

                    I would like to share my experience working with Education Transformation Centre (ETC). First I would like to say, the staff was very supportive of the child. They are very great with making sure the kids get an education. They also go above and beyond, if the student needs more assistance, Dr. Carr will get the student tutors for more one on one.
