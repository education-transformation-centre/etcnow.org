                I would like to share my experience working with Education Transformation Centre (ETC). First I would like to say, the staff was very supportive of the child. They are very great with making sure the kids get an education. They also go above and beyond, if the student needs more assistance, Dr. Carr will get the student tutors for more one on one. Education Transformation Centre makes sure the students achieve their goals that will get the student back into the regular school setting and for adulthood. My daughter used to be upset that she had to go through the program. After she got the understanding of the program, she starting accepting the things she had to do was only going to make her become successful in life.  ETC will continued to follow the student till graduation. So, my message to students and parents is ETC is a great program, I highly recommend it.  My daughter was struggling in math, ETC made her struggle come to ease. My daughter will be a graduate with her class of 2021.

                Dr. Carr was a steadfast presence in my client’s life which I feel helped her to see more positive possibilities for her future. Dr. Carr provided my client with individualized and focused support that she needed during a challenging time in her life. This extra support helped to scaffold my client’s sense of what a trustworthy relationship looks and feels like. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe that putting in the extra time and effort often help children/students to feel that they really do matter and that their life is meaningful and worthwhile. Being a constant, honest and present adult, helps to create trust in the relationship between adult and child. Young people need to learn what a safe and trusting relationship and I was able to witness Dr. Carr be that person for my client.  Dr. Carr's guidance through the positive seeds planted by the Education Transformation Centre, will have lasting effects on my client's life, whether she sees/feels it now or in her future.
            </p>
            <p>
                All the best Dr. Carr and I hope to work with you again very soon. I love what you are doing!

                I was impressed by the encouragement and support that was given to our grandson during the short time that he was enrolled there. He did not complete due to COVID-19. I felt that ETC was a good fit for him at that time because he was struggling in school. The ETC allowed him to work on his academics in a smaller setting as well as work on his behavior modification. 
            </p><p>
                I believe that the ETC will give students who just don’t fit in the mainstream school, a head start on their road to a successful educational experience.
            </p><p>
                Dr. Carr was always professional, informative and guided us through the enrollment process. She also followed up on his progress after the COVID shutdown. She continued to encourage him to be the best that he could be. 
            </p><p>
                I recommend that if your child is having difficulties in school and need one on one attention, take the time to check out what the Educational Transformation Centre can offer.
