I would like to share my experience working with Education Transformation Centre (ETC).
First I would like to say, the staff was very supportive of the child. They are very great
with making sure the kids get an education. They also go above and beyond, if the student
needs more assistance, Dr. Carr will get the student tutors for more one on one.

Education Transformation Centre makes sure the students achieve their goals that will get
the student back into the regular school setting and for adulthood. My daughter used to be
upset that she had to go through the program. After she got the understanding of the
program, she starting accepting the things she had to do was only going to make her become
successful in life. ETC will continued to follow the student till graduation.

So, my message to students and parents is ETC is a great program, I highly recommend it. My
daughter was struggling in math, ETC made her struggle come to ease. My daughter will be a
graduate with her class of 2021.
