I was impressed by the encouragement and support that was given to our grandson during
the short time that he was enrolled there. He did not complete due to COVID-19. I felt
that ETC was a good fit for him at that time because he was struggling in school. The
ETC allowed him to work on his academics in a smaller setting as well as work on his
behavior modification.

I believe that the ETC will give students who just donâ€™t fit in the mainstream school, a
head start on their road to a successful educational experience.

Dr. Carr was always professional, informative and guided us through the enrollment
process. She also followed up on his progress after the COVID shutdown. She continued to
encourage him to be the best that he could be.

I recommend that if your child is having difficulties in school and need one on one
attention, take the time to check out what the Educational Transformation Centre can
offer.
