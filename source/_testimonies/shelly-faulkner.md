Dr. Carr was a steadfast presence in my client’s life which I feel helped her to
see more positive possibilities for her future. Dr. Carr provided my
client with individualized and focused support that she needed during a challenging
time in her life. This extra support helped to scaffold my client’s sense of
what a trustworthy relationship looks and feels like.

I believe that putting in the extra time and effort often help children/students to feel
that they really do matter and that their life is meaningful and worthwhile. Being a
constant, honest and present adult, helps to create trust in the
relationship between adult and child. Young people need to learn what a safe
and trusting relationship and I was able to witness Dr. Carr be that person for my
client.  Dr. Carr's guidance through the positive seeds planted by the Education
Transformation Centre, will have lasting effects on my client's life,
whether she sees/feels it now or in her future.

All the best Dr. Carr and I hope to work with you again very soon. I love what you are
doing!
