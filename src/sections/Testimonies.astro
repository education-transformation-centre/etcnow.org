            <p>Dear Dr. Carr,</p>
            <p>
                Jackie and I are so excited about your school and what
                it offered us. When we first came to Education
                Transformation Centre, I didn't think Jackie had a
                dream in her spirit. With your help and attending your
                school, Jackie has many dreams.
            </p>
            <p>
                She is excelling in her schoolwork and focused more
                than I have ever seen her. When Jackie started, she
                was failing 9th grade. With improved attendance and
                help from your school, she successfully completed 9th
                grade in 4 months.
            </p>
            <p>
                I would suggest to parents who have children that may
                not be focused, seem not to care, just don't have it
                together or your child may be behind in their work and
                in their minds, they just don't know how to get caught
                up, please contact Dr. Dolores Carr with Education
                Transformation Centre.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jackie loves attending class and now does a great deal
                more school work at home. She has set a goal for when
                she wants to complete 10th grade and has plans to do
                dual classes to get some college credit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Jackie has done a complete turnaround. This is the
                best she has ever done. She has only attended private
                schools, but they did not bring out the best of all
                she can do. The Education Transformation Centre really
                transformed this young lady of mine into a new person!
                She has hopes and dreams like all young people should.
                We must keep the dream alive in our young people.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thank you, Dr. Dolores Carr and staff. WONDERFUL
                PEOPLE.
            </p>
            <p>
                Love, <br />Regenia & Jackie Smith, 10th grade student

                <p>
                    Here at STARS (Structured Therapeutic Adolescent
                    Residential Services) we serve youth 13-18 years
                    old who have experienced various traumas, losses,
                    and abuse; however, they can show a lot of
                    resilience and live successfully. Education
                    Transformation Centre (ETC) under Dr. Carr's
                    leadership was able to establish rapport with our
                    youth quickly where respect and hope was at the
                    core of their services from the beginning to end.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Carr certainly has a lot of expertise in
                    serving our population, in addition, the two
                    interns, displayed incredible energy and patience
                    to connect with our residents. Residents expressed
                    that they felt heard, trusted, and respected by
                    the ETC team. On this foundation, ETC was able to
                    help our residents unearth their potential thereby
                    increasing their resolve to be successful and
                    looking at how current behaviors dampen their
                    progress toward reaching current program goals.
                </p>
                <p>
                    What impressed us the most was the ability of ETC
                    staff to provide programing that kept residents
                    engaged at least 90% of the time during a
                    three-hour program, three days a week that was
                    creative, relevant, and inspiring. The first week
                    of the program, we heard staff remarking, "we need
                    to hire them now for next year," later STARS staff
                    were asking the question "how do we get them
                    involved with our youth during the school year"
                    and the final week staff expressing "we gotta have
                    them back next year."
                </p>
                <p>
                    We are grateful for the vast efforts of ETC to get
                    community speakers involved that could reinforce a
                    consistent message that you matter, you deserve
                    respect, and you are to respect others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, ETC did an excellent job of celebrating
                    our youth by having them decorate their space with
                    positive affirmations, putting on a talent show
                    and a business casual lunch at the Omni Hotel
                    where they learned social etiquette. Honestly, our
                    staff did not do anything terribly wrong, but the
                    residents may have behaved better than we did.
                    They were well prepared by ETC. At these events,
                    residents had a voice to express their personal
                    gratitude towards the STARS staff as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We highly recommend ETC's services without any
                    reservations.

                <p>
                    I would like to share my experience working with
                    Education Transformation Centre (ETC). First I
                    would like to say, the staff was very supportive
                    of the child. They are very great with making sure
                    the kids get an education. They also go above and
                    beyond, if the student needs more assistance, Dr.
                    Carr will get the student tutors for more one on
                    one.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Education Transformation Centre makes sure the
                    students achieve their goals that will get the
                    student back into the regular school setting and
                    for adulthood. My daughter used to be upset that
                    she had to go through the program. After she got
                    the understanding of the program, she starting
                    accepting the things she had to do was only going
                    to make her become successful in life. ETC will
                    continued to follow the student till graduation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, my message to students and parents is ETC is a
                    great program, I highly recommend it. My daughter
                    was struggling in math, ETC made her struggle come
                    to ease. My daughter will be a graduate with her
                    class of 2021.

                <p>
                    I was impressed by the encouragement and support
                    that was given to our grandson during the short
                    time that he was enrolled there. He did not
                    complete due to COVID-19. I felt that ETC was a
                    good fit for him at that time because he was
                    struggling in school. The ETC allowed him to work
                    on his academics in a smaller setting as well as
                    work on his behavior modification.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that the ETC will give students who just
                    donâ€™t fit in the mainstream school, a head start
                    on their road to a successful educational
                    experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dr. Carr was always professional, informative and
                    guided us through the enrollment process. She also
                    followed up on his progress after the COVID
                    shutdown. She continued to encourage him to be the
                    best that he could be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I recommend that if your child is having
                    difficulties in school and need one on one
                    attention, take the time to check out what the
                    Educational Transformation Centre can offer.

                <p>
                    Dr. Carr was a steadfast presence in my client's
                    life which I feel helped her to see more positive
                    possibilities for her future. Dr. Carr provided my
                    client with individualized and focused support
                    that she needed during a challenging time in her
                    life. This extra support helped to scaffold my
                    client's sense of what a trustworthy relationship
                    looks and feels like.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that putting in the extra time and
                    effort often help children/students to feel that
                    they really do matter and that their life is
                    meaningful and worthwhile. Being a constant,
                    honest and present adult, helps to create trust in
                    the relationship between adult and child. Young
                    people need to learn what a safe and trusting
                    relationship and I was able to witness Dr. Carr be
                    that person for my client. Dr. Carr's guidance
                    through the positive seeds planted by the
                    Education Transformation Centre, will have lasting
                    effects on my client's life, whether she
                    sees/feels it now or in her future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    All the best Dr. Carr and I hope to work with you
                    again very soon. I love what you are doing!
